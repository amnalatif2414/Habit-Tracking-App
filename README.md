# Habit Tracking App

## Description
The Habit Tracking App is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help users track their daily and weekly habits. It allows users to create habits, mark them as complete, and analyze their progress by tracking streaks. The app also provides options to delete individual habits or remove all habits at once. It uses an SQLite database to store habit data, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Complete habits** for the current date.
- **Track progress** by viewing streaks of consecutive habit completions.
- **Delete a specific habit** or **delete all habits**.

- **Persistent storage** of habits using SQLite.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later should be installed on your machine.
